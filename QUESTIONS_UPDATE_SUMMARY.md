## 🎯 Expected Impact

### High-ability students (0.9)
- **Before:** only ~5% improvement (limited by few hard questions)
- **After:** expected **30-40%** lift ⬆️

### Overall
- **Before:** 34.6%
- **After:** expected **45-50%** ⬆️

## 📝 New Topic Coverage

The 44 new questions cover:
- Advanced neural networks (Transformer, Attention, ResNet, etc.)
- Deep learning theory (Meta-learning, Few-shot learning, etc.)
- Unsupervised learning (GAN, VAE, Contrastive Learning, etc.)
- Reinforcement learning theory
- Cutting-edge tech (Flash Attention, Neural Architecture Search, etc.)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Re-run simulations**
   ```bash
   python simulation.py
   ```

2. **Compare results**
   - Check improvement at high ability (0.9)
   - Verify overall lift reaches 45-50%

3. **Update paper data**
   - Use new simulation results
   - Refresh figures and tables

## ✅ Checklist
